# Genomic Computational Analysis Templates
GCATemplates is a collection of template genomic batch job scripts that have successfully run on HPRC systems.

Most scripts have basic commands in order to help users become familiar with running bioinformatics software on HPRC systems.

Many scripts have sample data so you can run the template script to learn about the software output files.

The template scripts were provided by HPRC and HPRC users.

Be sure to do the following:

* Read the software manual and add, adjust or remove command options as needed
* Check for newer versions of the software in two places
    * on the cluster with module spider
    * on the web at the software's website
    * In some cases, changing the software module in the template to a newer software version will work but not always.
* Change the BSUB parameters and input files based on your data requirements
